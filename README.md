I'm putting the hard works of others into containers, primarily because I can't do anything else. 

All the real work was done by @harmj0y, @sixdub, @enigma0x3, rvrsh3ll, @killswitch_gui, and @xorrior found at https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire

I have no idea what extent this actually works, only that it works in a silly test environment.
